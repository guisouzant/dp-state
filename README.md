# Design Pattern: State ✨
Have You Heard About the State Design Pattern?
The State pattern is one of the 23 design patterns described in the classic book “Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software.” This pattern allows an object to change its behavior when its internal state changes. It does this by separating states into different classes and enabling the object to delegate behavior to the current state.

Do you know when an object needs to behave differently depending on its state? The State pattern solves this simply by separating each state into its own class. This way, the object changes behavior without you having to modify the entire code.

When should you use it?

When the object's behavior changes based on its state.
To avoid a bunch of if-else or switch statements that make the code messy.
When you want to make future system changes easier.

Some benefits:
- More flexibility: The object adapts without major code changes.
- Cleaner code: Each state has its own class.
- Simple maintenance: Changing or adding states is much easier.

Here's a Simple Example Using the State Design Pattern
